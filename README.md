**AnsCom Terminal** is a sophisticated, real-time stock and crypto analysis tool with a professional, Bloomberg-inspired interface. This major v2.0 update transforms the terminal from a single-asset viewer into a dynamic market analysis powerhouse.

The headline feature is **full market access**. We've replaced the static header with a powerful interactive **Command & Search Bar**, giving you direct access to the entire Nifty 500 Indian stock market, complete with intelligent, live search suggestions.

## üöÄ WHAT'S NEW IN v2.0: FULL MARKET ACCESS

This update is all about speed, access, and intuitive control.

### #FullMarketAccess
The terminal now comes pre-loaded with data for the **Nifty 500**. Track any major Indian stock, not just the default.

### #InteractiveCommandBar
A new dynamic command bar is your gateway to the market. Type your command to instantly switch between different stocks and update your share quantity.

### #LiveSearch
No need to memorize every ticker. As you type a stock symbol, a list of matching companies appears instantly. Just click to select.

### #SeamlessSwitching
When you load a new stock, the entire terminal adapts. The chart, profit calculations, and all info panels reset automatically for a clean, fresh analysis of the new asset.

### #ZeroConfigSetup
The terminal now automatically generates the required `ind_nifty500list.csv` file if it's not found on first launch. It just works, right out of the box.
